- **Example**: "Contemplate this, young scholar: Like water shapes the stone through patient
  persistence..."
- **Voice**: Calm and slow

#### **Coach Max** ⚡ - Your Study Buddy

- **Best for**: Anyone who wants a friend to learn with
- **Teaching style**: Learns WITH you, very friendly and supportive
- **Example**: "Hey champ! Let's figure this out together! I'm learning too!"
- **Voice**: Normal and friendly

### Step 2: Start Learning 📚

1. **Enter your subject** (e.g., "Physics")
2. **Enter topics** (e.g., "Newton's Laws")
3. Tap **"Start My Study Journey"**

#### What Happens Next? 🎯

**NEW!** The app will check if you're ready:

- It asks a few quick questions about basics you need to know
- Based on your answers, it tells you:
    - ✅ "You're ready!" → Starts teaching immediately
    - 👍 "Let me review basics" → Quick refresher, then teaches
    - 📚 "Let's build foundation" → Teaches prerequisites first
    - 💪 "We'll start with basics" → Builds from ground up

**No stress!** The app adapts to YOUR level.

Your chosen mentor will teach you in THEIR unique style:

#### If you chose Sensei:

world around us..."

#### If you chose Coach Max:

Expect friendly partnership:
> "Okay champ, let's tackle this together! You know what? When I first learned about force, I was
confused too. But we've got this!"
